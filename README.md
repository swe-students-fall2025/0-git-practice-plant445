 [Link](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-on-generative-ai) This is an article that I found interesting.

I found this article extremely interesting as it showcases Andy Jassy's opinions on Generative AI becoming more prominent at Amazon, and highlights how the technology is already reshaping customer experiences, internal operations, and long-term innovation strategies. This perspective has strong implications for other big tech companies as well, as it suggests that those who adopt AI broadly and early will be better positioned to transform their business models, streamline operations, and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive market. 

Additionally, this letter came out while I was interning at Amazon, and my team found it quite funny, as we had the lowest AI tools adoption rate in our org.
